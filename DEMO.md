Hi, this is Eric. Well, I'm the only one in the team, so that is the introduction of the team! Yay!

The problem I'm trying to solve is to capture and share the priceless moment from sport events.

This comes from my prior experience going to a couple stadiums like Dodger Stadium or Stable Center for sports events.

I found that my most enjoyable moment was not watching the game but cheering with the fans and enjoy the atmospheres around the stadium.

So, I want to capture this moment and share it out with the world like other side of sports fans watching events over the TV.

In summary, Sports 360 is for sharing sport fan reactions in 360 videos to TV.
