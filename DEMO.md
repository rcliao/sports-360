Hi, this is Eric working alone on the project. So this is a single person team.

The project is called Sports 360 trying to capture the priceless moments from sports events.

This comes from my prior experience of going to a couple stadiums for sports events like Dodger Stadium or Stable Center.

I found that the most enjoyable moment for me is not watching the game itself but the fan reactions and atmospheres around the stadium.

And I want to capture this moment and share it out to the other side of fans participating the events in a different form like watching through TVs.

Therefore I build Sports 360 for sharing fan reactions in 360 videos.
